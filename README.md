# Finger_Counting_Computer_Vision
* A simple Computer Vision project created to learn uses of OpenCV
* Uses computer vision to count the number of fingers held up by the user dynamically 

## Hand_tracking-module.py
A general module created for all my hand gesture tracking programs

## fingerCounting.py
Uses the hand tracking module to recognize user's hand and the fingers individually and counts and displays the number of fingers held up.

### Note
The program was calculates assuming the user uses their right hand. The formulae can be easily modified to work with the left hand as well. (The thumb is the only difference)
